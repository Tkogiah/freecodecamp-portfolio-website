          <p>I am intentionally leaving my codepen open because I have a lot of small projects or practices where i was trying to figure something out and I have found codepen to be a fast tool for learning the basics of web development. Feel free to look at the specifics of what I have worked on and how things have gotten better over time.</p>

          <a id="atag" href="https://codepen.io/tkogiah/full/zYzZjwL" target="_blank">My Ajax/Jquery project</a>
          <p>I feel like this project was where things really started clicking for me. Pulling JSON through an API using a real AJAX request and dynamically rendering it to the DOM. I did this pen twice,the firt time without Jquery and then I refactored it using Jquery. The API I used is a JSON file containing a list of Lorum ipsum. I could have styled this with CSS but the purpose of the practice was to really just understand how APIs and AJAX works.</p>

          <a id="atag" href="https://codepen.io/tkogiah/full/eYRaEXj" target="_blank">Technical documentation</a>
          <p>This project was much more difficult than I anticipated, which is why I really enjoyed it. The tension, the stress, the anger. A lesson in semantic HTML, fixed position navbars, and @media adjustments for mobile and desktop response.</p>

        <div class="project">
          <a id="atag" href="https://codepen.io/tkogiah/full/GRELyMo" target="_blank">My Product landing page</a>
          <p>Oh the joys of nested flex boxes. What took the longest was figuring out how to get their Icons in the code. This wasn't an exhilirating project and it took me less time than I thought it would. I learned a little bit about @media and resizing the page based on mobile response. This was also a practice and education in semantic HTML</p>

          <a id="atag" href="https://codepen.io/tkogiah/full/MWoxzWy" target="_blank">Freecodecamp Survey</a>
          <p>For this project I wrote out on a piece of paper exactly how I felt everything should be nested, and it basically worked out mostly how I had planned. The feeling of knowing what I was doing in a design relived a lot of the tension and allowed me to focus on what I needed to learn: html forms and input controls. I went back to the basics and worked with freecodecamp because I felt as though my HTML and CSS skills weren't as good as my JavaScript.</p>

          <a id="atag" href="https://codepen.io/tkogiah/full/VwWeMpJ" target="_blank">e commerce quiz</a>
          <p>Ok so this project was all about using event listeners and just bruting my way through code to make something happen. Even though my JavaScript wasn't as clean as I had wanted it, I gave myself a deadline for this project and I did it the only way I knew how. I will most likely go back and refactor this in the future or write a new one entirely as I now have a better understanding of JavaScript.</p>
